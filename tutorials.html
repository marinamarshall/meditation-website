        <p>Upward-Facing Dog/Urdhva Mukha Svanasana
            From Low Plank/Chaturanga, drop your hips down to the floor and flip your toes over so the tops of your feet touch the floor.
            Tighten your core and straighten your arms to push your chest up. Pull your shoulders back, squeeze your shoulder blades, and tilt your head toward the ceiling, to open up your chest.
            "Feel free to drop your knees down to reduce tension in your low back, or skip Upward-Facing Dog and hold High Plank instead," says Peterson.</p>
        <p>Tree/Vrksasana
            Start in mountain pose with your toes together and heels slightly apart.
            Bring your right foot to the inner thigh of your left leg. Squeeze your foot and inner thigh together. The knee of your right leg should be turned out and your right thigh facing down toward the ground at a 45-degree angle.
            Once you’ve found your balance, lift your hands to prayer position in front of your chest (as shown), or up overhead if that feels better for you.
            Keep your gaze focused on a fixed point in front of you to help stay balanced.
            Hold for 5–10 breaths, then switch sides.
            If you're having a tough time balancing, try placing your right foot on your left shin instead of the thigh, Peterson says.</p>

        <h2>Mind</h2>
        <p>Begin with just 5 minutes a day, and increase your time as the exercise becomes easier and more comfortable.
            If 5 minutes feels too long, start with just 2 minutes.
            Practice multiple times a day. Schedule set times or practice conscious breathing as you feel the need.</p>

        <p>Diaphragmatic breathing
            Belly breathing can help you use your diaphragm properly. Do belly breathing exercises when you’re feeling relaxed and rested.
            
            Practice diaphragmatic breathing for 5 to 10 minutes 3 to 4 times per day.
            
            When you begin you may feel tired, but over time the technique should become easier and should feel more natural.
            
            To do it:
            
            Lie on your back with your knees slightly bent and your head on a pillow.
            You may place a pillow under your knees for support.
            Place one hand on your upper chest and one hand below your rib cage, allowing you to feel the movement of your diaphragm.
            Slowly inhale through your nose, feeling your stomach pressing into your hand.
            Keep your other hand as still as possible.
            Exhale using pursed lips as you tighten your stomach muscles, keeping your upper hand completely still.
            You can place a book on your abdomen to make the exercise more difficult. Once you learn how to do belly breathing lying down you can increase the difficulty by trying it while sitting in a chair. You can then practice the technique while performing your daily activities.</p>
        <p>Deep breathing
            Deep breathing helps to relieve shortness of breath by preventing air from getting trapped in your lungs and helping you to breathe in more fresh air. It may help you to feel more relaxed and centered.
            
            To do this:
            
            While standing or sitting, draw your elbows back slightly to allow your chest to expand.
            Take a deep inhalation through your nose.
            Retain your breath for a count of 5.
            Slowly release your breath by exhaling through your nose.</p>
