## About The Website
 Meditate is a three-page website designed to teach simple and effective mindfulness and meditation techniques.
 
 In a world that is constantly changing with more challenges, it is important for our mental and physical health to learn coping skills to self-soothe and relax. The goal of this website is to help people of all ages and backgrounds, using straight forward and powerful techniques of decreasing stress and increasing awareness on a daily basis.
 
 The design of the website ensures ease of use and first-use learning. There are two sections for the tutorials page; one is dedicated to mind exercises such as breathing techniques and body scanning and the other section is for yoga poses so the client can choose what they would prefer. There is also a daily check-in page for those who want to journal. This is useful as everything from mindfulness and meditation to reflecting on the day is all on the one website.

### The Strategy Plane
1. The site owner's goal is to teach users specific mindfulness and meditation techniques.

2. The user goal is to learn specific mindfulness and meditation techniques.

3. Meditation and mindfulness don't require a set level of skill or experience and therefore it is suitable for people of all ages and backgrounds. It is a particularly useful set of techniques to learn if stress and anxiety are a part of a person's daily life. Mindfulness and meditation add pause and calm to any day.
4. This website will cover specific techniques and offer a journal in the format of a form. Currently the form does not do anything with the data it receives, but that would be part of a future release, to offer a personalised mood tracker any diary-entry system.
5. There are three sections for the page: Home, Tutorials and Check-in. The header and footer remain a similar layout accross all three pages for continuity.
6. Owners want to make profit, so a subscription service as a future release is being considered.
7. Users generally want related items all on one website. A potential future release could be an online store.  

### The Scope Plane
1. The website covers basic, free tutorials and a non-saved journal to begin with. It is a three-page website and uses the same layout approach to keep it simple for the user.  

2. Future Releases
    * Subscription services, plans
    * Online mood tracker
    * Saved journal entries
    * Soundtracks
    * Online shop
    * The science behind mental health, manifestation and the law of attraction

### The Structure Plane
1. Home Page
    * Navigation menu and Logo positioned similarly accross all pages
    * Footer and social media icons positioned similarly accross all pages
2. Tutorials Page: the information is grouped together based on what it targets:

    * Body section: three tutorials are featured, they are un-related to each other. There is one video and two written instructions.
    * Mind section: three tutorials are featured, they are un-related to each other. There is one video and two written instructions.

3. Check-in Page
    * This section is presented as a form. The method has been set to "GET" where it would normally be "POST" and the action has been left as blank so that results do not go anywhere. 

### The Skeleton Plane

These are some mock-ups made using Balsamiq, they are the rough idea of what the website was intended to look like.

### The Surface Plane

#### Layout/Structure
 The website pages will be split into three sections horizontally. The header, The body and The footer. On each page, the body layout will be divided roughly into thirds going vertically. This is to give visual balance and to allow paragraphs of text and images/videos to be displayed inline with each other and then when the screen size is decreased, the responsive features will stack the elements one on top of the other.

#### Colours  
* Calming background colours, such as blue, green and lavender are most suitable for the website 
* There is a background image behind the Home Page paragraphs of information. This is to distinguish it as a section of its own to the user and provide the visual balance again going back to the 1/3 rule that is being applied accross the website.
* Font colours are either light on a dark background or dark on a light background. This improves user experience and readability. The colours/background do not interfere with the information being presented.
* Typography
    * The fonts Noto Sans and Roboto are the main fonts used for the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font import fails to load. The fonts chosen are easy to read and look good.

## Technologies used

### Languages used
* HTML 5 
* CSS3

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used

* Google Fonts - The fonts Noto Sans and Roboto were imported from Google Fonts to style text elements accross the website.
* Google Developer Tools -  Used throughout the coding process to assess errors in positioning and styling.
* Font Awesome - The Social Media Icons were imported from Font Awesome. They provide instant recognition to users as to what social media platform they link to.
* Github - Github was used to store the project code after being pushed from Git. 
* Git - Git was used as a version control, using gitpod to edit the code and using the terminal to add and commit code with key messages that were to be pushed to Github.
* Balsamiq - This platfrom was used to create the wireframes for the project. They were created before any code was written to assess layout and content before looking at specific styles.
* Hover.css: - Hover.css: was used on the Navigation Menu, Social Media Links and the Submit and Clear buttons on the form page.



## Features
* Responsive design on all device sizes
* Interactive elements - such as navigation bar with colour change, underline and .active class added to emphasise the current tab the user is on.

### Navigation Bar
Continuity across all three pages of the website. Easily accessible way of navigating the site and gives the viewer an overall view of the website and what to expect. Links to the Home page, Body and Mind and Check-In page.

### Home Page
This section gives the user some background on what the practice of mindfulness and meditation is, the site mission and some of the key benefits of practicing daily.

### Tutorials Page
This section introduces the user to both body and mind exercises. It is displayed in an easy to use way with three beginners exercises for each category. There is one video for each section, accompanied by two written  tutorials.

### Check-In Page
This section is for the user to fill in the details of how their day went. Currently, it doesn't do anything with the data, this would be for a future release, so that the user can track their mood and gratitude.

### Footer
Stays the same across all three pages of the website. Includes links to social media (that would be up and running in the future). 
Links open in a new tab for good user experience.
The social media aspect is important to keep users up to date if there are any changes to the website and to get socially connected with other users.
