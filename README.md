### About the Website
 Meditate is a three-page website designed to teach simple and effective mindfulness and meditation techniques.
 
 In a world that is constantly changing with more challenges, it is important for our mental and physical health to learn coping skills to self-soothe and relax. The goal of this website is to help people of all ages and backgrounds, using straight forward and powerful techniques of decreasing stress and increasing awareness on a daily basis.
 
 The design of the website ensures ease of use and first-use learning. There are two sections for the tutorials page; one is dedicated to mind exercises such as breathing techniques and body scanning and the other section is for yoga poses so the client can choose what they would prefer. There is also a daily check-in page for those who want to journal. This is useful as everything from mindfulness and meditation to reflecting on the day is all on the one website.
